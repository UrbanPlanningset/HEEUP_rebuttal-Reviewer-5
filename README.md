##  Q1 Supplement：HEEUP vs [1，2]
| Difference   | HEEUP                                        | [1]                                      | [2] | Remarks                                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Objective    | Minimize energy consumption for efficient urban layout | Adapt to complex terrain, optimize urban community spatial planning | Focus on road planning, emphasizing accessibility, connectivity, and travel distance | HEEUP focuses on energy efficiency, [1] on terrain adaptability, [2] on road planning |
| Strategy     | Hierarchical decision-making: from macro to micro optimization | Sequential decision-making: dynamic adaptation, continuous planning | Two-stage shielding strategy optimization to achieve universal connection quickly and increase roads to reduce travel distance within slums | HEEUP uses hierarchical vs. [1] sequential decision-making process, [2] stages for universal connection |
| State        | Comprehensive urban feature encoding (GAT+GAE), capturing full-spectrum multi-dimensional information | Progress and data encoding (GNN+Encoder), reflecting real-time planning dynamics | GNN state encoder | GAT in HEEUP enhances feature interrelation vs. GNN in [1] focuses on progress and statistics, [2] uses GNN for state encoding |
| Action       | Multi-dimensional actions, adjusting various aspects of urban planning from macro to micro | Focused on single decision-making for land use and roads | Road planning | HEEUP allows multi-level refinement vs. [1] single-point decision-making, [2] focuses solely on road planning |
| Reward       | Energy efficiency as the core metric at each hierarchical level | Service quality, ecological balance, and traffic flow efficiency make up a composite reward system | Two-stage connectivity priority reward system | Tiered focus on energy in HEEUP vs. diverse urban benefits in [1], [2].|
